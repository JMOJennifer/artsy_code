Exploration of code as an alternative artistic medium.

I've been learning to code under the standard "How do I make this happen / how to I fix these bugs?" mentality.
But when someone once suggested writing a poem in code, I thought back to when I learned a year of Japanese in college.
I've had an interest in Japanese culture/cultural works/language before that formal education, and something quite intriguing about
Japanese is the ability for a kanji (a Japanese character adopted from Chinese characters) to have one meaning in the character,
but list a separate smaller writing above called furigana which may convey a separate meaning. (Such as, per [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furigana), an astronaut 
writing the kanji for "Earth" but writing the meaning "hometown" above the character. Or even an opposite meaning, to indicate that 
someone is lying or feeling conflicted about something/someone.) It's a potential added layer of depth to the language, a concept that I've always loved but is much harder to achieve in English. 
(Puns are often similar but more limited in available options.)

It occurred to me that in coding, particularly Ruby because it's a human-readable language, this is possible with the use of variables to
contain strings. So one could achieve multiple layers of depth not just in what is outputted from a program, but within the
code itself. I'm looking forward to both the typical learning of how to program, and thinking about how to apply new ideas and concepts
for artistic works.

Fun facts: furigana is considered a [ruby character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_character), Ruby is an obvious language with
which to try this "codeplay", and the creator of Ruby is Japanese!
